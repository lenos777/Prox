# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The website has a scrolling issue where users cannot scroll to the very bottom of content in various sections. This prevents users from accessing all content and creates a poor user experience. The scrolling stops before reaching the actual end of the content, leaving some content inaccessible.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to scroll to the very bottom of any page content, so that I can access all information without any content being cut off or inaccessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls down on any page THEN the system SHALL allow scrolling to the very bottom of all content
2. WHEN a user reaches the bottom of content THEN the system SHALL show appropriate bottom padding/margin to ensure content visibility
3. WHEN content extends beyond viewport THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling to access all content
4. WHEN a user scrolls on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain the same scrolling behavior as desktop

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent scrolling behavior across all pages and sections, so that I have a predictable and smooth browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates between different pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent scrolling behavior
2. WHEN a user scrolls in modal dialogs THEN the system SHALL allow full content access within the modal
3. WHEN content is dynamically loaded THEN the system SHALL update scroll boundaries accordingly
4. WHEN a user uses keyboard navigation (Page Down, End key) THEN the system SHALL scroll to the actual bottom of content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper visual feedback when I reach the end of content, so that I know there is no more content to view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reaches the bottom of content THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indication that the end has been reached
2. WHEN scrolling reaches the bottom THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing from viewport edges
3. WHEN content ends THEN the system SHALL prevent over-scrolling or bouncing effects that might confuse users
4. WHEN a user scrolls quickly to bottom THEN the system SHALL smoothly decelerate and stop at the proper position
